🎉 Welcome to **Avalia**, a free and open-source platform developed by [Hotay](#about-hotay) to facilitate the evaluation process of projects in Scientific Initiation Fairs. Our goal is to provide a simple and accessible tool that supports teachers and evaluators, especially in public schools, bringing more technology to the daily life of the school community.

## ✨ Main Features

- **Administrative Area:** Allows configuration and management of the science fair, including project creation, evaluator management, and ranking visualization.
- **Evaluators Area:** Simplified access via link, where evaluators can easily perform their assessments without the need for password login.

## 💡 Project Philosophy

Avalia was created based on five fundamental pillars:

- **Free of Charge:** 💸 A completely free tool, especially aimed at public schools.
- **Open Source:** 🔓 The project is open source, allowing anyone to access, modify, and contribute.
- **Importance of Open Source:** 🤝 We strengthen school and developer communities through collaboration and transparency.
- **Technology in School Community:** 🏫 We bring accessible and practical technology to the daily life of schools.
- **Facilities for Teachers:** 👩‍🏫 We reduce teachers' workload, facilitating project management and evaluation.

## 🚀 Contribution and Open Source
